  description: |
    Axway AMPLIFY Streams augments your application programming interface (API) infrastructure with an event-driven layer for publishing data from your APIs. 
    This is possible by making the APIs available as real-time streams of events that can be consumed by web, mobile or other applications as well as servers. 
    Go beyond the traditional request-response paradigm and its limitations. 
    AMPLIFY Streams uses server-sent events (SSE) and JSON Patch to push only new data to subscribed clients.
    
    #### Check out its awesome features:
    * Up to 90% reduction of cost of data sharing
    * Reduced onboarding time of new partners from 3 months to 3 hours
    * Significant decrease in bandwidth/network consumption
    * Enhanced UX experience for end user
